Credit Card Fraud Detection System
Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Credit Card Fraud Detection System. The project's goal is to accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions in a large dataset using machine learning models. By training a model on historical transaction data, the system can predict whether a new transaction is legitimate or fraudulent, helping to mitigate financial losses.

Problem Statement
Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions and consumers, leading to billions of dollars in losses annually. The challenge lies in identifying fraudulent transactions, which are rare and often disguised within a massive volume of legitimate transactions. This project addresses this by building a classification model capable of detecting these anomalous patterns with high precision and recall.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles data cleaning, feature scaling, and handling of imbalanced datasets.

Model Training: Trains and evaluates various machine learning models to find the optimal one for fraud detection.

Performance Evaluation: Provides metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a Confusion Matrix to assess model performance.

Scalability: Designed to handle a large volume of transaction data efficiently.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Core Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

scikit-learn: For machine learning models, data splitting, and evaluation.

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

Environment: Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation.

Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset containing credit card transactions, which includes features like Time, Amount, and several anonymized features (V1-V28). The dataset is highly imbalanced, with only a small percentage of transactions labeled as fraudulent. The data was sourced from [mention your data source, e.g., Kaggle, a specific research paper, or a synthetic source].

Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure, distribution, and identify any issues.

Data Preprocessing: Anonymized features were already scaled. The Amount and Time features were scaled using StandardScaler. To address the class imbalance, a sampling technique was applied (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling, etc. - specify what you used).

Model Selection: Several classification algorithms were explored, including:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest
